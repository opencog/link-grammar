/* An ordered set of gword pointers, used to indicate the source gword
 * (Wordgraph word) of disjuncts and connectors. Usually it contains only
 * one element.  However, when a duplicate disjunct is eliminated (see
 * eliminate_duplicate_disjuncts()) and it originated from a different
 * gword (a relatively rare event) its gword is added to the gword_set of
 * the remaining disjunct. A set of 3 elements is extremely rare. The
 * original order is preserved, in a hope for better caching on
 * alternatives match checks in fast-match.c.
 *
 * Memory management:
 * A copy-on-write semantics is used when constructing a new gword_set.  It
 * means that all the gword sets with one element are shared.  These gword
 * sets are part of the Gword structure. Copied and added element are
 * alloc'ed and chained. The result is that the chain_next of the gword
 * sets that are part of each gword contains the list of alloc'ed elements -
 * to be used in gword_set_delete() called *only* in sentence_delete().
 * This ensures that the gword_set of connectors doesn't get stale when
 * their disjuncts are deleted and later restored in one-step parse when
 * min_null_count=0 and max_null count>0 (see classic_parse()).
