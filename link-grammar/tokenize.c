/**
 * Disallow unsplit_word alternatives with the same subword string path.
 * (I.e. we are talking about preventing Wordgraph paths consisting of the same
 * word strings in the same order, not consisting of same graph nodes.)
 *
 * The first subword of the candidate alternative is checked against the first
 * subword of all the existing alternatives of the unsplit_word (this allows the
 * first alternative unconditionally).
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - unsplit_word: the unsplit_word that shouldn't have redundant paths.
 * - altword0: the first word of the candidate alternative.
 * Return true if the alternative is redundant, false if it is fine.
 *
 * Assumptions and heuristics:
 *
 * - This function is invoked only for subwords that we try to split in every
 *   possible combination, i.e. LR-split. It is not invoked for morpheme
 *   splits, because then an identical first subword mat be valid due to
 *   a different way of performing the splits.
 *
 * - If the first subword of the checked candidate alternative is the same as an
 *   already existing alternative, it means the candidate alternative is
 *   redundant. This is because we are going to generate all the subword
 *   combinations for the other subwords, a thing that would generate an
 *   identical Wordgraph sub-path otherwise. So the alternative is disallowed.
 *
 * - The previous step may allow an unknown first subword to not split further
 *   to a known word plus punctuation, a thing that will leave an unwanted
 *   unknown word in the Wordgraph. To prevent this we also check if an existing
 *   first subword is a prefix of the first (unknown) subword of the candidate
 *   alternative. If it is, it means that a future split would be prevented by
 *   the previous step.
 *
 * Examples (the words and alternatives are shown in () for clarity):
 *
 * 1. An input word ('50s,) splits to (' 50s,). An additional split of this
 * input word to ('50s ,) would be prevented if '50s was not a known word, as
 * (') is a prefix of ('50s). The split of ('50s) to (' 50s) is prevented by
 * this function because its first subword matches the first subword of an
 * existing alternative (' 50s,).
 *
 * 2. The input word ("who") gets split to (" who"). Its split to ("who ") is
 * then prevented, as (") is a prefix of ("who) which is unknown.
 *
 * XXX I don't have a mathematical proof of correctness, it just happens to work
 * on the example sentences. [ap]
 *
 * FIXME XXX What if a non-first subword is unknown and cannot split further?
 * For example, for ('50s,) we get an alternative (' 50s ,) in which (50s)
 * cannot split further because another alternative also starts with (50), but
 * (50s) is an unknown word (that doesn't usually cause a trouble because
 * tokens in that alternative don't have a linkage). It will be a good idea to
 * find out exactly how it happens and a way to avoid that.  A fix "by force"
 * may be to explicitly mark unknown-words in separate_word() (as originally
 * designed) and in flatten_wordgraph() ignore alternatives that have
 * so-unmarked unknown words.

	Here's a summary of how subscripts are handled:

	Reading the dictionary:

	  If the last "." in a string is followed by a non-digit character,
	  then the "." and everything after it is considered to be the subscript
	  of the word.

	  The dictionary reader does not allow you to have two words that
	  match according to the criterion below.  (so you can't have
	  "dog.n" and "dog")

	  Quote marks are used to allow you to define words in the dictionary
	  which would otherwise be considered part of the dictionary, as in

	   ";": {@Xca-} & Xx- & (W+ or Qd+) & {Xx+};
	   "%" : (ND- & {DD-} & <noun-sub-x> &
		   (<noun-main-x> or B*x+)) or (ND- & (OD- or AN+));

	Rules for chopping words from the input sentence:

	   First the prefix chars are stripped off of the word.  These
	   characters are "(" and "$" (and now "``")

	   Now, repeat the following as long as necessary:

		   Look up the word in the dictionary.
		   If it's there, the process terminates.

		   If it's not there and it ends in one of the right strippable
		   strings (see "strip_right") then remove the strippable string
		   and make it into a separate word.

		   If there is no strippable string, then the process terminates.

	Rule for defining subscripts in input words:

	   The subscript rule is followed just as when reading the dictionary.

	When does a word in the sentence match a word in the dictionary?

	   Matching is done as follows: Two words with subscripts must match
	   exactly.  If neither has a subscript they must match exactly.  If one
	   does and one doesn't then they must match when the subscript is
	   removed.  Notice that this is symmetric.

	So, under this system, the dictionary could have the words "Ill" and
	also the word "Ill."  It could also have the word "i.e.", which could be
	used in a sentence.

 * Split off punctuation and units from the right.
 *
 * Comments from a previous rewrite try of right stripping, not exactly applied
 * to the current method but discuss some relevant problems.
 * ---
 * FIXME: Adapt and move to separate_word().
 * Punctuation and units are removed from the right-hand side of a word,
 * one at a time, until the stem is found in the dictionary; then the
 * stripping stops.  That is, the first dictionary hit wins. This makes
 * sense for punctuation and units, but wouldn't work for morphology
 * in general.
 *
 * The only thing allowed to precede a units suffix is a number. This
 * is so that strings such as "12ft" (twelve feet) are split, but words
 * that accidentally end in "ft" are not split (e.g. "Delft blue")
 * It is enough to ensure that the string starts with a digit.
 *
 * Multiple passes allow for constructions such as 12sq.ft. That is,
 * first, "ft." is stripped, then "sq." is stripped, then "12" is found
 * in the dict.
 *
 * This code is incredibly delicate and fragile. For example, it needs
 * to parse "November 17th, 1771" with the comma stripped, the 17th
 * matched by a regex, but not get a units split for h, i.e. not get
 * the "17t h" split where h==hours-unit.
 *
 * It must also parse "7grams," with the comma split, the s in grams
 * NOT matched by S-WORD regex.
 *
 * Also, 7am must split, even though there's a regex that matches
 * this (the HMS-TIME regex).
 *
 * However, do NOT strip "sin." into "s in." (seconds, inches)
 * or "mold." into "mol d ." (chemistry mol, dioptre)
 * or "call." int "cal l ." (calorie litre)
 * Here, the period means that "sin." is not in the dict.
 *
 * Finally, it must strip the punctuation off of words that are NOT
 * in the dictionary, but will later be split into morphemes, for
 * example, in Lithuanian: "Skaitau knygą."  The period must come off.
 *
 * Basically, don't fuck with this code, unless you run the full
 * set of units sentences in 4.0.fixes.batch.
 *
 * Perhaps someday, improved morphology handling will render this code
 * obsolete. But don't your breath: the interplay between morphology
 * and regex is also quite nasty.
 * ---
 *
 * The classnum parameter is the affix class of strings to strip.
 * The rootdigit parameter adds a check that the root ends with a digit.  It is
 * used when stripping units, so we don't strip units names off potentially real
 * words.
 *
 * w points to the string starting just to the right of any left-stripped
 * characters.
 * n_r_stripped is the index of the r_stripped array, consisting of strings
 * stripped off; r_stripped[0] is the number of the first string stripped off,
 * etc.
 *
 * When it breaks out of this loop, n_r_stripped will be the number of strings
 * stripped off. It is returned through the parameter, after possibly adjusting
 * it so the root will not be null. A pointer to one character after the end of
 * the remaining word is returned through the parameter wend.
 *
 * The function returns true if an affix has been stripped (even if it
 * adjusts n_r_stripped back to 0 if the root was null), else false.
 *
 * p is a mark of the invocation position, for debugging.
 *
 * FIXME: Units may get strip without a root number.
 * In the current batch examples this doesn't cause errors or extraneous
 * parsings. But it unnecessarily adds to the total number of sentence words.
 * For example "sin" is gets split to "s in" and "As" to "A s" (unless an
 * example can be provided in which it is beneficial).
 * The fix should be to reconsider the root number, or remove the code that
 * checks it.

 * This function splits up the word if necessary, and calls
 * "issue_word_alternatives()" on each of the resulting parts ("subwords"),
 * creating an "alternative" to the original unsplit_word.
 *
 * This is used to, e.g, split Russian words into stem+suffix, issuing a
 * separate subword for each.  In addition, there are many English
 * constructions that need splitting:
 *
 * 86mm  -> 86 + mm (millimeters, measurement)
 * $10   ->  $ + 10 (dollar sign plus a number)
 * Surprise!  -> surprise + !  (pry the punctuation off the end of the word)
 * you've   -> you + 've  (undo contraction, treat 've as synonym for 'have')
 *
 * The original separate_word() function directly created the 2D-word-array used
 * by the parser. This version of separate_word() is a rewrite that creates a
 * word graph, referred in the comments as Wordgraph. It is later converted to
 * the said 2D-word-array by flatten_wordgraph().
 *
 * The current separate_word() code is still too similar to the old one, even
 * though some principles of operation are radically different: the separated
 * subwords are now put in a central word queue, from which they are pulled out
 * one by one. If a word is marked by TS_DONE, it will be removed from
 * the word queue without further processing.
 *
 * The function gets each word in the queue, separates it to subwords and create
 * alternatives from each such separation, until all the separating
 * possibilities are exhausted.
 *
 * FIXME: The old code, although working, is convoluted and contains redundant
 * parts. It needs much cleanup efforts, also to make it more flexible and
 * efficient, and at the same time prevent extra splitting (i.e. prevent issuing
 * alternatives which create graph paths with the same sequence of subwords as
 * existing parallel graph paths).
