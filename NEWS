http://www.abisource.com/downloads/link-grammar/5.2.0/link-grammar-5.2.0.tar.gz

This is a major release of the parser, with many important changes in
it.  The internals of the parser have been re-organized, resulting in
a speedup of 2x to 4x for typical English texts.  Multiple multi-
threading bugs were fixed, and there is now a simple multi-threading
unit test.  A memory leak was fixed, and a memory over-consumption
bug was fixed.  These changes were enabled by the final removal of the
"fat link" code from the parser.

Parser internals work continues apace: it is expected that a version
5.3.0 will follow shortly, featuring a completely re-designed tokenizer.
This redesign should enable simpler and better morphology support.

The ChangeLog notes other fixes as well:

Version 5.2.0 (27 December 2014)
 * y'all, ain't, gonna, y'gotta: Beverly Hillbillies basilect.

WHAT IS LINK GRAMMAR?
The Link Grammar Parser is a syntactic parser of English, Russian,
Arabic and Persian (and other languages as well), based on Link Grammar,
an original theory of syntax and morphology.  Given a sentence, the
system assigns to it a syntactic structure, which consists of a set of
labelled links connecting pairs of words. The parser also produces a
"constituent" (HPSG style phrase tree) representation of a sentence
(showing noun phrases, verb phrases, etc.).  The RelEx extension
provides Stanford-style Dependency Grammar output.

[ANNOUNCE] link-grammar version 5.1.0

Version 5.1.0 of link-grammar is now available for download at
http://www.abiword.org/downloads/link-grammar/5.1.0/link-grammar-5.1.0.tar.gz

This version includes a number of important changes. One of these is
that the connectors can now be given a direction (head and tail
indicators), so that link-grammar dependencies can now be true,
hierarchical dependency arrows.  This is of marginal importance for
English, where dependency directions are implicit, but is vital for
free-word-order languages, where bi-directional links are not enough.

Another important change is that costs can now be arbitrary floating
point numbers. This is particularly useful for providing fine-grained
parse ranking.  The LG cost system assigns a "cost" to every connector,
and the sum-total of costs for a sentence determines the parse ranking.
Since costs are additive, they behave as entropies (log P -- the
logarithm of a probability: probabilities are multiplicative, logarithms
are additive).

Under the covers, there's been some major work on the tokenization
(splitting sentences into words) and morphology (splitting words into
morphemes) code.  This work is ongoing, and should eventually result in
much better support for non-English languages.

Other notable changes include an updated Russian dictionary, and an
assortment of changes to the English dictionary.  An intriguing step
towards phonology: LG can now distinguish between the use of the
determiners "a" and "an" preceding nouns that start with consonants
or vowels.  Whether fancier phonology support is possible is a curious
question.

The full changelog is below:

 * Updated Russian dictionaries from Sergei Protasov.
 * Added morphology-based unknown-word handling for Russian, from Sergei.
 * Fix up fat-linkage code, which was recently broken...
 * API cleanup: many command-line options never belonged in the API.
 * New emoticon support was clobbering certain dictionary words.
 * Fix: "Go to spot X", "It happens at time T."
 * Add a dozen missing verbs.
 * Minor work on greetings.
 * Add mechanism for denoting fractional costs in the file-backed dict.
 * Fix: broken handling of gerunds (due to bad verb-wall connectors)
 * Major redesign of morpheme splitting mechanism (from AmirP)
 * Minor extensions to support numeric formulas, e.g. 1 + 1 = 2.
 * Remove fat linkage support from the SAT solver.
 * Enable build of SAT solver by default.
 * Fix multiple bugs with unit stripping.
 * Add bounds-checking to the C API.
 * Fix the old disjunct-printing implementation.
 * Add support for easy-to-use link direction indicator.
 * Add random morphology generator tool.
 * Partial support for phonetic use of "a" vs. "an" for English.
 * Rework how coordination between conjunctions works: "either... or ...", etc.
 * Major redesign of tokenization mechanism (from AmirP)

Version 5.0.0 of the Link Grammar Parser is now available.

(Yes, its April 1st.  No, this is not a joke.  Maybe I'll think of
something snarky next year.)

We are proud to announce a major new release of the Link Grammar Parser!
It contains many important changes and new additions.  One of the most
significant changes is that the license has been changed from the BSD
license to the LGPL.  This was done to enable considerably more
flexibility in accepting contributions to the project: it seems that
few are particularly interested in contributing to a BSD-licensed project.
This change has enabled folding in some new work:

 o Arabic and Persion dictionaries!  These were previously maintained
   as separate add-ons.  Including them as part of the distribution
   should make it easier for interested users.

 o A new 'bindings' directory, containing code for Java, Python, Common
   Lisp, OCaML and AutoIt programming languages.  The Python bindings
   are an updated version of the older pylinkgrammar-0.2.13 bindings.
   A SWIG interface file should make it easy to create other language
   bindigns as well.

 o Improved morphology support. This will be invisible to most users,
   but it lays the groundwork for add Hebrew support to the parser.

 o Expanded Lithuanian support. This remains a simplistic prototype, but
   it now performs a more sophisticated morphological analysis.

 o Experimental Turkish and Hebrew dictionaries.

 o A demo of the JSON parser server: it shows how to run the server,
   which will accept accept raw sentences on a socket, and returns the
   parsed forms.

 o Some slightly incompatible changes to the API: it was time for some
   housekeeping.

 o Misc minor updates to the English Language dictionaries.

 o Preliminary work for SQL-backed dynamic dictionaries. This should
   enable certain types of automated language learning.

The full changelog is shown below.

Version 4.8.5 of the Link Grammar Parser is now available.

This is the third release in about a week; each prompted by a
build-break in the previous version.  Sorry!  There's been assorted
(minor) new work, and this has been enough to cause trouble for
various people.

Some notable changes in the last 6 weeks:
 * Improved Russian (UTF-8) support for MSWindows users.
 * Build files for MSVC12
 * Several Java binding fixes
 * English dictionary: add a verb-wall connector for present participles.

A full list of changes is given below. If none of these seem to affect
you, there is no particular need to upgrade.

=================================================================

Version 4.8.0 of the Link Grammar Parser is now available.

This is the start of a new version series, containing an important
change to the English language dictionary. Three new link types are
introduced WV, CV and IV. These are used to connect the left-wall to
the primary verb of the sentence (WV), to connect the ruling clause
to the primary verb of a dependent clause (CV), and a similar link
for certain infinitive verbs (IV).  The goal of these links is to
make it easier to locate verbs, and thus to provide a more direct
mapping from the link-grammar formalism to a dependency parse (as
dependency parses always put the verb at the root of a sentence).

These are not the first links that explicitly indicate root verbs:
several other link types already play this role: The AF, CP, Eq, COq
and B links already play this role. The new WV, CV and IV links
round out this capability and do so in a very general form.  See
http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/dict/section-WV.html
for details.

With this release, we expect that all (non-auxiliary) verbs in a
sentence will be linked either to the wall, or to a controlling parent.
We also expect there to be some additional fixes and tightening-up
to occur in future releases, especially in regards to comparative
sentences.

This release also includes a variety of fixes to the Java API/server.
In addition, some ancient, deprecated C code was removed.

Version 4.7.12 of the Link Grammar Parser is now available.

The biggest change in this version is a sharply updated Russian
dictionary, which fixes a large number of bugs generated during
during the initial release.  Thanks to Sergey Protasov who did
almost all this work!

The other notable change is that the fat-link code is no longer
build by default.  It will be permanently removed in some future
version, "real soon now".

Version 4.7.0 of the Link Grammar Parser is now available.  This version
introduces a major restructuring of the manner in which conjunctions are
handled.  Conjunctions are no longer indicated with "fat links"; instead,
a helf dozen new link types (non-fat, of the ordinary kind) are introduced.
This allows for a more careful and precise treatment of conjunctions; it
significantly reduces the number of exceptional cases handled in the C code,
and results in faster parser: from 1.3x to 2.7x faster, depending on the
text.
