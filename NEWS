Version 4.8.0 of the Link Grammar Parser is now available. 

This is the start of a new version series, containing an important
change to the English language dictionary. Three new link types are
introduced WV, CV and IV. These are used to connect the left-wall to
the primary verb of the sentence (WV), to connect the ruling clause
to the primary verb of a dependent clause (CV), and a similar link
for certain infinitive verbs (IV).  The goal of these links is to
make it easier to locate verbs, and thus to provide a more direct
mapping from the link-grammar formalism to a dependency parse (as
dependency parses always put the verb at the root of a sentnece).

These are not the first links that explcitly indicate root verbs:
several other link types already play this role: The AF, CP, Eq, COq
and B links already play this role. The new WV, CV and IV links
round out this capability and do so in a very general form.  See
http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/dict/section-WV.html
for details.

With this release, we expect that all (non-auxilliary) verbs in a
sentence will be linked either to the wall, or to a controlling parent.
We also expect there to be some addtional fixes and tightening-up
to occur in future releases, especially in regards to comparative 
sentencs.

This release also includes a variety of fixes to the Java API/server.
In addition, some ancient, deprecated C code was removed.

WHAT IS LINK GRAMMAR?
The Link Grammar Parser is a syntactic parser of English (and other
languages as well), based on link grammar, an original theory of English
syntax.  Given a sentence, the system assigns to it a syntactic
structure, which consists of a set of labelled links connecting pairs of
words. The parser also produces a "constituent" (Penn tree-bank style
phrase tree) representation of a sentence (showing noun phrases, verb
phrases, etc.). The RelEx extension provides dependency-parse output.
