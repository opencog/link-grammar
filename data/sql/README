                Parse Ranking and Word Sense Statistics
                ---------------------------------------

This directory contains SQL tables that are used in computing a parse
ranking, as well as a word-sense probability (based on WordNet 3.0) by
looking up frequency statistics from an SQL database. The database used
is the SQLite database; it has been choosen because it is "administration
-free" for the user, and because its license is compatbile with the
current link-grammar license.

Disjuncts Table
---------------
The disjuncts.db database contains two tables. The first records the 
probability that a given disjunct will be used for some given word.
This probability was measured by parsing a large quantity of text, 
and simply counting disjunct frequencies.  This probability can be 
used to rank parses, or to discriminate between alternate parses 
for a sentence.

CREATE TABLE Disjuncts (
   inflected_word TEXT NOT NULL,
   disjunct TEXT NOT NULL,
   log_cond_probability FLOAT
);
CREATE INDEX ifwdj ON Disjuncts (inflected_word, disjunct);

The log_cond_probability field contains the value of -log_2 p(d|w)
where p(d|w) is the conditional probability of seeing the disjunct d
given that the (inflected) word w was already seen.


Word Senses Table
-----------------
The DisjunctSenses table associates word senses to (word,disjunct)
pairs.  The core idea behind this table is that certain word senses
are used only in certain ways in sentence constructions, and that 
the Link Grammar disjuncts are fine-grained enough to detect such 
differences, if they exist. The key idea is "if they exist" -- in
most cases, grammar is insufficient to discriminate between word
senses in a sentence -- but in some cases, it is.  The goal here 
is to try to provide this info, as well as possible.

CREATE TABLE DisjunctSenses (
   word_sense TEXT NOT NULL,
   inflected_word TEXT NOT NULL,
   disjunct TEXT NOT NULL,
   log_cond_probability FLOAT
);
CREATE INDEX siwdj ON DisjunctSenses (inflected_word, disjunct);

The log_cond_probability field records -log_2 p(s|w,d) where s==sense,
w==word, d==disjunct, so that p(s|w,d) is the probability of seeing the
sense s, given the word w and the disjunct d.  This probability was 
obtained by parsing a large quantity of text, and then applying the 
Radu Mihalcea word-sense disambiguation algorithm to it.



Notes:
------
To populate the disjunct table:
pg_dump -D -O -t disjuncts lexat


To populate the disjnuct-senses table:
Recompute the conditional probs by:
opencog/nlp/wsd-post/dj-probs.pl

Then remove the count column, and the bogus entries:

select word_sense, inflected_word, disjunct, log_cond_probability into djsxxxtmp from DisjunctSenses where log_cond_probability > 0;

pg_dump -D -O -t djsxxxtmp lexat
