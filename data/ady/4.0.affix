% Number of alternatives to issue for a word. Two values: minimum and maximum.
% If the word has more possibilities to split than the minimum, but less

% sampling until the minimum number is reached or all possibilities exhausted.

% When all word parts match these regexes,
% the word is issued as an alternative.
% Multiple regexes per class are permitted.
