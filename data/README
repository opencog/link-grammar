--------------------

de -- German. Contains dictionaries for a few thousand words, that's
      all. Incomplete.

en -- English. Complete set.

he -- Hebrew. Experimental prototype. Contains a few dozen words.

lt -- Lithuanian. Experimental prototype. Contains a few hundred words,
      and implements only a few parts of speech.

ru -- Russian.  Complete set of dictionaries, should parse most text.
      Support needs to be added for conjunctions (and, or, but...)
      Could use work on supporting regular expressions for numbers,
      Russian-ized Latin technical terms, etc.  See the English 4.0.regex
      file for more.

tr -- Turkish. Experimental prototype. Contains a few dozen words.

any -- Will parse "any" language, exploring all combinatoric possibilities.
       This is useful for certain machine-learning tasks, when one might
       want to iterate over all possible parse trees in every way.
