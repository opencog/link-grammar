Note: See also "BUILDING on Windows" in "../README".

This directory contains project files for building Link Grammar with the
Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 IDE (MSVC14). They were created and tested with
the Community Edition of that product.


Dependencies
------------
The regex package, which includes libraries and header files, must be
separately downloaded. Also see GNUREGEX_DIR below.


Setup
-----
The build files make use of two User Macros, defined in the property
sheet "Local" - GNUREGEX_DIR and (optionally) JAVA_HOME, as follows:

-- GNUREGEX_DIR must be pointing to an unzipped POSIX regex distribution
   (which has the subdirectories "include" and "lib"). Its default is
   "%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\Libraries\gnuregex".
   If the environment variable GNUREGEX exists, its value is used instead.
   The library file name is assumed to be "regex.lib" and needs to be
   generated from the DLL if it is not included in the distribution (see
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9946322).

-- JAVA_HOME, if used, must be pointing to a locally installed SDK/JDK,
   which has the subdirectories "include" and "include/win32" (defined in
   the LinkGrammarJava project under Common properties->C/C++->General->
   Additional Include Directories.
   If your JAVA SDK/JDK installation has defined the JAVA_HOME environment
   variable (check it) then there is no need to define this User Macro.


Compiling
---------
- To compile LinkGrammar, open the solution file LinkGrammar.sln and build

- The solution configuration is configured to create a debug version by
  default.  It's probably a good idea to switch a "Release" configuration.
  You can do this at Build Menu->Configuration Manager.

- The wordgraph-display feature is enabled when compiled with
  USE_WORDGRAPH_DISPLAY (defined in the LGfeatures property sheet
  Common properties->C/C++->Preprocessor/Preprocessor Definitions.


Running
-------
The last step of the "LinkGrammarExe" project creates "link-parser.bat".  Copy
it to somewhere in your PATH and then customize it if needed (don't customize
it in-place, since rebuilding would overwrite it). Especially, add to PATH the
directory in which the regex DLL resides (see the line containing "DLLs"). If
you would like to display the wordgraph (see below) set also the PATH for
"dot.exe" if it is not already in your PATH.

If USE_WORDGRAPH_DISPLAY has been used when compiling (the default), then
typing !test=wg at the "link-parser" prompt can be used in order to display the
wordgraph of the next sentences to be parsed. See "../linkgrammar/README" for
how to use optional display flags.  By default, "PhotoViewer.dll" is invoked to
display the graph.  If X11 is available and your "dot.exe" command has the
"xlib" driver, it can be used to display the wordgraph when the x flag is set
(i.e.  !test=wg:x), for example when running under Cygwin/X. In any case it
uses the "dot" command of Graphviz. Graphviz can be installed as part of Cygwin
(in which case it included the "xlib" driver"), or separately
(http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php).  Both "PhotoViewer.dll" (if
used) and "dot" must be in your PATH (if needed, you can customized that in a
copy of "link-parser.bat", as described above).

BTW, when running under Cygwin, don't exit link-parser by using ^C or ^Z -
the shell may get stuck because the program somehow may continue to run in the
background.  Instead, exit using !exit .


NOTE: The created DLLs need the MSVC14 runtime environment to run. This is
normally already installed in your machine with the installation of the IDE.
But to be able to run Link Grammar on other computer you need to install the
Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 from:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145
This redistributable does not contain debug version of the MSVC runtime, so
only "Release" Link Grammar will work with it.


Implementation notes:
---------------------

- The file "link-grammar/link-features.h.in" has a Custom Build Tool definition
  which invokes "mk-link-features-h" to generate
  "link-grammar/link-features.h", with LINK_*_VERSION variable replacement as
  defined in "configure.ac".

- The project file "LinkGrammarExe" has a Post-Build-Event definition for
  generating "link-parser.bat".


Using a remote network share
----------------------------
In order to use a link-grammar source repository from a network share (e.g. via
Samba), and still be able to use the custom build steps in the Project files,
there is a need to "convince" Windows it is a local filesystem.  Else you will
get "UNC path are not supported." on the batch runs, with bad results. This
method will also allow the "link-parser.bat" file to run.  (For other solutions
see tackoverflow.com/questions/9013941). You will need to find out by yourself
if this makes a security or another problem in your case.

Here is what worked for me:
Suppose you use host:/usr/local/src remotely as share "src":

mklink /J src-j \\host\src
mklink /D src src-link

The second one needs administrator privileges.
Then use the repository through "src".
