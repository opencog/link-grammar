               Link Grammar Parser - Patched Version
               -------------------------------------
                       Version 4.3.0

This directory contains a *patched* version of the final original 
release of the Link Grammer Parser.  It has been patched to fix a 
few bugs, add a few enhancements, and, in general, make the Link 
Grammar Parser easier to use. This version includes Java bindings.

It is released under the BSD license (which is GPL compatible), 
making it freely available for private and commercial use, with 
few restrictions.  The terms of the license are given in the 
LICENSE file included with this software, and also available at 
http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/license.html.

Please see the web page http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/
for more information.  The original website, including documetation,

CONTENTS of this directory:

   LICENSE                  The license describing terms of use

   link-grammar/*.c         The program.  (Written in ANSI-C)
   
   data/en/4.0.dict         The file containing the dictionary definitions.

   data/en/4.0.knowledge    The post-processing knowledge file.

   data/en/4.0.constituents The constituent knowledge file.

   data/en/4.0.affix        The affix file.

   data/en/tiny.dict        A small sample dictionary.

   data/en/words/*          A directory full of word lists.

   data/en/4.0.batch        This is a batch file of sentences (both grammatical
                            and ungrammatical ones) that are handled correctly
                            by this release of the system.  Feed this into the
                            parser with "./parse 4.0.dict < 4.0.batch"

   configure                The GNU configuration script

CREATING the system:

   To compile the link-grammar shared library and demonstration program, 
   at the command line, type:

        ./configure
        make

   To install, change user to "root" and say

        make install

   This will install the lib-link-grammar.so libarary into /usr/local/lib
   the header files in /usr/local/include/link-grammar
   and the dictionaries into /usr/local/share/link-grammar.

   The /usr/local install target can be over-ridden using the 
   standard GNU configure --prefix option, so for example:

      ./configure --prefix=/opt/link-grammar


RUNNING the program:

   To run the program issue the unix command:

       ./grammar-parse 

   This starts the program.  Help is available there with "!help".  A
   number of user-settable variables control what happens.  "!var" shows
   these variables and their current values.

   The program can run in batch mode for testing the system on a large
   number of sentences.  The following command runs the parser on
   a file called 4.0.batch

       ./grammar-parse < 4.0.batch

   The line "!batch" near the top of 4.0.batch turns on batch mode.  In
   this mode sentences labeled with an initial "*" should be rejected
   and those not starting with a "*" should be accepted.  Any deviation
   from this behavior is reported as an error.

USING the parser in your own applications:

   There is a API (application program interface) to the parser.  This
   makes it easy to incorporate it into your own applications.  This is
   documented on our web site.

   This release includes a very simple Java binding.  It can be
   accessed by copying the file LinkGrammar.java into your java project.

COMMERCIAL use:

   The original authors would be pleased to discuss alternate 
   licensing terms and/or additional research work, with those 
   wanting to use this system under a paid contract.

   Academic products or papers should reference the verious
   link grammar publications.
